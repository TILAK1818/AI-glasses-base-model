***AI-Powered Smart Glasses for Visually Impaired Users (Phase One)***
This project focuses on developing AI-powered smart glasses that assist visually impaired users by capturing images, generating scene descriptions, and providing audio feedback. Phase one includes basic functionality, where the glasses capture an image, analyze the scene, and narrate the surroundings to the user through audio.

*Project Overview*
In this phase, the primary goal is to provide visually impaired users with a description of their immediate surroundings. The glasses use computer vision to capture an image, process it, and deliver an audio description to inform the user of objects, people, and other significant elements in the scene.

*Key Features in Phase One*
Image Capture: Captures an image from the user's point of view.
Scene Description Generation: Analyzes the captured image and generates a brief description of the scene.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts the generated description into audio output for the user.
"Capture Again" Functionality: Allows the user to take a new image, replacing the previous capture and refreshing the description.

*Installation and Setup*
Prerequisites
Hardware Requirements:

A camera module (such as a webcam or a camera connected to a Raspberry Pi).
A speaker or earphones for audio output.
Software Requirements:

Python 3.8 or higher
OpenCV for image capture and processing
Streamlit for the user interface
Pyttsx3 or a similar TTS library for audio output
Other dependencies as listed in requirements.txt

*Setup Steps*
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-powered-glasses-phase-one.git
cd ai-powered-glasses-phase-one
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the Camera and Audio Output:

Ensure your camera and audio devices are connected and functional.

*Run the Application:*

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Usage
Capture an Image:

Once the application is running, press the "Capture Image" button to take an image of the current scene.
Generate a Description:

After capturing, the system will analyze the image and produce a description of the scene, identifying key elements.
Hear the Description:

The description will be read aloud through TTS, providing the user with an auditory summary of their surroundings.
Capture Again:

To refresh the scene, click the "Capture Again" button. This deletes the previous image and captures a new one, generating a new description.
File Structure
app.py: Main application file for running the Streamlit interface.
requirements.txt: Contains all the Python dependencies needed for this phase.
tts.py: Module responsible for converting text descriptions into audio output.
Project Roadmap (for Future Phases)
This phase is the foundation of the project. Future phases will build upon this by adding:

Obstacle detection for navigation assistance.
Real-time guidance and environmental awareness.
Voice commands for user control.
